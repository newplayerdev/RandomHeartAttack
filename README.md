A simple and really useful PMMP 5.x plugin that gives you a slim chance of dying of a hearth attack anytime while you are playing.

- Every player is assigned a random tick lifespan upon joining.
- This countdown is saved and persists across disconnections.
- When the time runs out, the player instantly dies from a heart attack.
- Random Lifespan: from a few seconds up to 300 hours of non-stop gameplay (can be changed in the code if you'd like to)
