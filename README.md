The risk of dying from a heart attack, anytime.

A simple PMMP 5.x plugin that injects a dose of hardcore survival into your server.

    Every player is assigned a random tick lifespan upon joining.

    This countdown is saved and persists across disconnections.

    When the time runs out, the player instantly dies from a heart attack.

    Random Lifespan: from a few seconds up to 300 hours of non-stop gameplay (can be changed in the code if you'd like to)
